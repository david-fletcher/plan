# Plan

`Plan` is a super simple layout helper designed for use with Love2d.

_Plan is in its very early stages, and is probably not ready for the big time.
Use with caution!_

## Usage

`Plan` is designed to sit all within a single file, and can easily be thrown
into your lib folder:

```lua
local Plan = require "path.to.libs.plan"
```
